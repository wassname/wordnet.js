Fork of [wordnetjs](https://github.com/nlp-compromise/wordnet.js) for frontend usage.

This unpack the json data on install. It loads the data from you server then promises it's api.

Install:

`npm install git+https://github.com/wassname/wordnet.js.git`

Usage:

```javascript
var WordNetJs = require('wordnetjs')
var dataPath = 'node_modules/wordnetjs/data' // or where ever you host the data
var wordNet = new WordNetJs().load(dataPath)
wordNet.then((wn) => {
    //generic lookup
    wn.lookup('warrant')
    //6 results

    //pos-specific lookups
    wn.verb('warrant') // (1 result)
    wn.adjective('cheeky')
    wn.adverb('slightly')
    wn.noun('grape')

    //sugar
    wn.synonyms("perverse")
    // [{id:"depraved.adjective.01"...}]
    wn.antonyms("perverse")
    // [{id:"docile.adjective.01"}]
    wn.pos("swim")
    // [ 'Verb', 'Noun' ]

    // unique, alphabetical list of all words
    wn.words((arr)=>{
      console.log(arr.filter((w)=> w.match(/cool/))
    })
    // [ 'air-cool', 'air-cooled', 'cool',  'cool down', ...
})
```

----

loving build of [wordnet](http://wordnet.princeton.edu/) in JSON.

no memory pointers, no python, no DSL, no guff. no crazy-framework stuff at all.

the data is zipped for github, but it automatically unzips when you first install it.

    npm install wordnetjs

if you just want the JSON, unzip ./data.zip
then you can just do your random shit.
it's 6mb -> 32mb

it's the cutest way to use wordnet by a pretty wide margin.


# Liberties taken

## Symmetric-relations
if the holonym of 'sausage' is 'sausage meat', the reverse (called a 'meronym') is almost always true.

As the beautiful George Miller [explains](http://books.google.ca/books?id=Rehu8OOzMIMC), the meronym-holonym relations, and the hypernym-hyponym relations are symmetric with few exceptions. Ignoring these exceptions reduces the filesize by half, so I did it.

To go from 'sausage meat' to 'sausage', just query the opposite direction.

## Antonyms on synsets
Adjective synsets in wordnet have no antonyms, but rather each individual word-sense has an antonym. This makes wordnet's antonym data really specific, but for most purposes, that's probably overdoing it. delete.

## Kill 'Coordinate-terms'
Given wordnet is a graph, this is just redundant data. delete.

## Reformatted glosses
Use only 1 gloss (description) per synset, and split it by semicolon-seperators.

## Same-As links
Most Nouns include freebase ids and wikipedia titles. There were reconciled in a mostly-manual process by freebase in 2010.
